        Bingu Wamutharika was a man with the heart to serve his countrymen.Now you are wondering who Bingu was.Well, he was the president of the Republic of Malawi from <br>
        2005 to 2012 when he died whilst he was still the president of the republic of Malawi.
        </p>
       
        <p class="forPs">
        Bingu was an economist who ventured into politics and turned out to be successful during his early years of leadership.Most citizens of the republic of Malawi loved <br>
        Bingu because he performed well during his first term .Therefore Bingu won again as the president of the republic of Malawi during the 2009 elections.While there may<br>
        be allot of shortfalls that were identified during the last days of Bingu’s leadership, I would like to only talk about the good things that we as Malawians will<br>
        remember the late Bingu Wamutharika for.I would like to recognise some of the notable accomplishments that this man achieved.
       </p>
       
        <p class="forPs">
        There are many things that Bingu accomplished that we can point out such as subsidizing farm inputs (fertilizer and seeds ) to allow households with low income to be able<br>
        to purchase these inputs.I do not mean to be bias but let me talk about this , I personally I do come from a district called Chitipa which did not have the tar marked<br>
        road for years but during Bingu’s reign , this project was materialized , he also brought the Malawi University of Science and Technology which is now producing graduates<br>
        with various skills in science and technology which is good for Malawi as a nation.There is quite a substantial amount of accomplishments that Bingu achieved which <br>
        I may be not aware of .besides all these accomplishments . Bingu was recognised with the following awards :<br>
        <ul>
